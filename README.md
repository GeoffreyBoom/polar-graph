polar-graph
===========

A relatively simple program for generating graphs of your favourite Polar functions.

For every value in the range 0-1000, it draws a single point on the display window in real time. 
The advantage of drawing in real time is that it shows the user the progression of the graph,
and presents the graph as a collection of points rather than the standard "filled" line.
